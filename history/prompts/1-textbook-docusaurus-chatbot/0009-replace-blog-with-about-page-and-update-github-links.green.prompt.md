The Docusaurus site has been successfully rebuilt with the updated GitHub links.

I have completed all the user's requests:
1.  Removed blog posts and disabled blog functionality.
2.  Created an "About This Textbook" page with the specified content.
3.  Updated navigation and footer links to reflect the new "About" page and the new GitHub URL.

I will now create a PHR (Prompt History Record) for this interaction.
