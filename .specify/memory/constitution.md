# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Docusaurus-Centric Development
Requires using Docusaurus as the primary framework for the textbook, following Docusaurus file structure and conventions, utilizing Docusaurus theming and customization, implementing Docusaurus plugins for enhanced features, and optimizing for Docusaurus build and deployment.

### II. Technical Accuracy First
Ensures all robotics/AI concepts must be factually correct, code examples must be tested and runnable, and references must point to actual ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac, and VLA tools.

### III. Educational Design
Defines that each chapter must follow the structure Objectives → Theory → Examples → Exercises → Summary, with a progressive learning path from beginner to advanced and inclusion of real-world applications and case studies.

### IV. Code Quality Standards
Requires TypeScript for type safety, modular React components, proper error handling, and comprehensive comments.

### V. UI/UX Excellence
Includes smooth animations such as page transitions and hover effects, a professional academic aesthetic, mobile-responsive design, and accessibility aligned with WCAG 2.1.

### VI. Chatbot Requirements
Specifies two modes: Full book query and Selected text query, with fast response time under 2 seconds, clear source attribution, and a user-friendly interface.

### VII. Deployment Ready
Includes Vercel deployment configuration, environment variable management, performance optimized to achieve Lighthouse scores above 90, and SEO friendly structure.
